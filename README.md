# Electricity-price-vs-Weather
This was a group project where we chose to research the effect of predictable weather data on electricity prices. Particularly, if we could predict a price surge
by looking at upcoming weather forecasts. Unfortunately I do not have the entire code as it was moved to a shared google drive which no longer exists. The included
code is from the early days and has the preprocessing code. However what we did and our findings can be seen in the pdf document.
